First, clone the file in your desktop using "git clone <repo link>"
After that go that folder that you have created using "cd <filename>".
After that install the node modules file using the command "npm i"
If you are getting any dependency issue while installing node modules, just try this code "npm config set legacy-peer-deps true"
After this try to install the file again using the command "npm i"
